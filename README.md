# Rough Idea Project Cars CSharp

## Description

This is work in progress, these are my first attempts at CSharp so I have a big learning curve.
I'm just going to add/change files as I go, so to build anything you will have to create your own local project.

No Guarantee this is going to work or be correct I'm just going to post code as I do minimal testing to get something to work i.e. small iterations and being concrete early.

Also have done a set of C++ Classes https://github.com/leroythelegend/rough_idea_project_cars

## Getting Started

Just take a look at src/pcars/Program.cs it has where I'm upto.
